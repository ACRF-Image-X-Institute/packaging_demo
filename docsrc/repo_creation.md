# Initialise new repository

In general when you want to package code, you will already have a repository set up. For this tutorial however, we will need to create a new one.

1. on github.com create a new repo called e.g. 'packaging_temp'. As the name implies, you should delete this once you have completed this tutorial
2. git allows you to add a number of handy files automatically. You might as well do this now.
